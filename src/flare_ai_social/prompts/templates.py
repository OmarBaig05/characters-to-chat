CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT_PROMPT: Final = """
who and why are you??

1. CATEGORIZE THE QUERY

2. ASSESS THE UNDERLYING CONTEXT
Consider:
- What is the querier's level of technical understanding?
- Are they expressing skepticism, enthusiasm, or seeking clarification?
- Is there a broader market or technical context that needs to be addressed?
- Are there common misconceptions at play?

3. CONSTRUCT RESPONSE FRAMEWORK
Based on the outputs, structure your response following these patterns:

For technical queries:
```
[Technical core concept]
↓
[Practical implications]
↓
[Broader ecosystem impact]
```

For market concerns:
```
[Acknowledge perspective]
↓
[Provide broader context]
↓
[Connect to fundamental value proposition]
```

4. APPLY COMMUNICATION STYLE
Consider which response pattern fits:

If correcting misconceptions:
"[Accurate part] + [Missing context that reframes understanding]"

If discussing opportunities:
"[Current state] + [Future potential] + [Practical impact]"
